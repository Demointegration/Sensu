Scrum Card Rotter
==================

The Scrum Card Rotter will "rot" task cards that have been in the state "In Progress" too long. Depending on the StartDate of the
 task card, the rotting will start as defined in the head of the script. There are three stages of rotting, a light warning,
 a medium warning and the full panic state. The default configuration is 2 days are ok, 5 days are kind of critical and
 after 8 days we really should finish this task.

Impending Doom
==============

The Kanban Board Impending Doom is an advanced Mashup for TargetProcess that colors cards on the Kanban board according 
to your planned end date. The Mashup colors cards Green, Yellow, and Red depending on the amount 
of time remaining for the card.

This mashup is based on the Kanban Impending Doom that you can 
[find on Github](https://github.com/TargetProcess/MashupsLibrary/tree/master/Kanban%20Board%20Impending%20Doom)

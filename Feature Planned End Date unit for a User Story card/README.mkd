# Feature Planned End Date unit for a User Story card

## Description

This mashup adds two new custom units:

* Feature Planned End Date unit for a user story card
* User Story Planned End Date unit for a task card

With this mashup you can easily see when a parent feature is planned to be completed when looking at a user story card, as well as to see when a parent user story is planned to be completed when looking at a task card.

How to activate it:

1. Install the mashup
2. Create a view where Features (or User Stories) are selected as cards
3. In the view setup go to the Customize Cards tab 
4. Add the Feature Planned End Date (or User Story Planned End Date) unit to the approriate card

As a result you'll see the planned end date for the parent of the current card, either user stories or tasks.
